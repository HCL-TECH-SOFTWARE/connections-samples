# About Nifty Scripties

Nifty Scripties combines 10 commonly used Customizer samples into a single app for demo and educational purposes. The application is available in the IBM Connections Catalog for cloud tenants. Essentially the catalog app installs an equivalent of the [niftyScriptiesApp.json][1] file into the App Registry for tenant organizations, and automatically applies an end-user filter to run the application only for the organization adminstrator. This is to facilitate experimentaion with IBM Connections Customizer and make it easier to get up to speed with this offering.

On-Premises customers can copy/paste the JSON file in this folder to their local App Registry to achieve the same result. The contents of each `include-repo` referenced in the JSON file need to be deployed to the local `pv-connections/customizations` directory on the Storage node. The end-user filter can be modified and expanded to engage testers, developers and evaluators as needed.

Watch this space - more information coming shortly...
