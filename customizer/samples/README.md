# Welcome to global-samples for HCL Connections Customizer & AppRegistry

## What's Here?
### Customizer Samples
Each folder in this repository contains a separate sample designed to demonstrate some of Customizer capabilities. You can try them out in your organization by copy/pasting one or more of the sample JSON files into the [Application Registry][2] in your Connections Component Pack deployment (requires Org Administrator access). For experimental purposes, you can restrict the user audience by using some of the matching criteria explained [here in the online documentation][1] - e.g. if you just want to see the samples yourself and not expose them to all users.

To modify these customizations based on these samples you can clone this repository or copy content into a repository of your own. More information on how to do this can be found [here][3].

### AppRegistry Extensions
Some folders contain json extension definitions that enable integrations with other 3rd party applications, such as Microsoft Teams (as used in the Connections 7.0 release).

### Issues
Any queries or problems with the examples should be logged as [Issues][4] in this repository.
