# Using the New File Menu Customization

## Overview
The new_file_menu extension displays new custom item(s) in the "New" dropdown menu in Files; example below shows Contract and Support Issue links added.

## Modifying the New File Extension Example JS Script
Below is a list of parameters which need to be supplied in the example JS script provided in this repository:

Variable Name | Purpose
------------- | -------
**APP_NAME** | The App name for the new file extension for example: "My New File Extension".
**APP_ID** | Add a unique App Id using a format similar to this: "my_new_file_extension".
**EXT_URL** | Add the file extension url and any context data parameters (org_id, user_id, subscriber_id) that will have real values substituted.

The extension varaiable for example **extension_new_1** should follow a similar JSON format as provided in the example with a unique name/id.

The JSON extension definitions should then be placed in an array as shown in the **extensions_new** array variable in the example below.

These are the contextual data parameters for the new file extension url, as they were in Connections Cloud, that can be passed to the receiving application:

Parameter Name | Value
-------------- | ------
**${user_id}** | The email address of the current user.
**${subscriber_id}** | The user identifier of the current user. 
**${org_id}** | The organization identifier of the current user.

Here is an example of how to define two new file menu extensions using the example JS script and the parameters listed above:
```js
var extension_new_1 = {
    APP_NAME: "My New File Extension 1",
    APP_ID: "my_new_file_extension_1",
    EXT_URL: "https://www.example.com",
};
var extension_new_2 = {
    APP_NAME: "My New File Extension 2",
    APP_ID: "my_new_file_extension_2",
    EXT_URL: "https://www.example.com?org=${org_id}&subscriber=${subscriber_id}&email=${user_id}",
};
var extensions_new = [extension_new_1, extension_new_2];
```

## Outline of New File Extension Process Flow
The provided example uses a mix of Dojo and Javascript to dynamically add new extensions points to the existing new file dropdown menu.

Define one or more extensions using the details provided above at the top of the example JS script. Try to define the extensions using the example syntax provided as these values are referenced throughout the example JS file.

There is an event listener checking if the target mouse click is one of the dropdown buttons/links corresponding to a location for the new file menu extensions, these are the following locations:

1. The Create Item dropdown menu:
    - Wait for the file dropdown menu to appear.
    - Grab the dropdown table and last table elements.
    - Append the new extension element with the provided extension information to the existing dropdown table following the last table element.
    - Update the newly added extension with the same hover, active, and selected css effects.
    - Add an on click event to the new extension using the newly constructed file extension url.

## Registering the Customizer Extension
In order for Customizer to insert this customization:

1. Put the custom JS script file onto the MSP environment.
2. Launch the appregistry UI at **/appreg/apps** URL (requires admin access).
3. Create a **New App** definition.
4. Go to the **Code Editor** section and remove the JSON outline.
5. Paste in the content of the file [new-file-menu.json](./new-file-menu.json) file.
6. If necessary, modify the **include-files path and file name** to match the location and name of the JS script file on the MSP environment.
   
See section [2.5.1 Hosting the Custom JS / CSS Files](../../doc/README.md/#251-hosting-the-custom-js--css-files) of the main [Connections Cloud Application Extension Migration](../../doc/README.md) documentation for more details about where to host the custom JS/CSS files.

## Troubleshooting / Validation
Below are some common troubleshooting issues and how to potentially solve those issues and validate that the custom extension script is working properly. Addition console log statements can be added to the custom JS script to help with debugging.

Issues | Potential Solutions
------------- | -------
The console message "New File extension script loaded." wasn't displayed when accessing the files page and there aren't any errors in the browser console. | Check the browser network trace to see if the custom JS script file was loaded successfully.
The new file extension script was loaded successfully but the custom file extensions are not displaying. | The first place to look would be the "on click" event listener. Check that the target elements for the file menu and preview menu dropdowns are correct and can be queried successfully for example: ```dojo.query("#lconn_files_action_more_0");``` this should return and element. Additionally if you are using another script for the file_menu extensions make sure the declared extension variables provided are unique and not using the same names as the new_file_menu extension variables.
The new file extension script "on click" events are working properly but the custom file extensions are not displaying or this is triggering browser console errors. | Try adding some additional console log statements. After clicking the dropdown button link, inspect the dropdown table elements in the dom using the browser dev tools. Check that the IDs for the generated dropdown list match what the dojo queries in the script are looking for. For example: ```dojo.query("#lconn_files_action_more_0_dropdown");``` this should return an element.
The custom new file extensions were successfully added to the file menu dropdown list, but the hover, active, or "on click" events aren't working properly. | Try adding some additional console log statements and check that the target elements for the dropdown list elements are correctly displaying on mouse over and mouse leave events as well as the on click event for the newly added extension. Additionally check that the hover and active classes for the newly added elements are correct along with the additional css styling to match the existing dropdown table elements.
